# Project3 - KrishToken Crowdsale

We are a software development company who want to launch a Crowdsale fund raising by selling our own fungible tokens (KrishToken) created under ERC-20 standard. KrishToken will be used to buy game avatars which are represented by non-fungible tokens created under ERC-721 standard. The project will be deployed in Metaverse. 

The back-end will consist of the following contracts:
1) KrishTokenMintable
2) KrishTokenCrowdsale
3) ArtToken-NFTContract

The front-end will consist of the following:
1) Web based User Interface (Streamlit Libraries)
2) Web3 Libraries for calling contract functions
3) Metamask is used to transfer ether to project wallet account
